==oyster 0.4==

--Requirements--
For oyster.py (the backend), you need mpg321 and/or ogg123 in $PATH.
For the GUI, you need an apache with the capability to execute python-CGI

Below you will find an example for the apache-config. It will allow
python-scripts to be executed.

| AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .sh .py
|
| [...]
|
| <Location /oyster>
|        Options +ExecCGI
| </Location>

--Installation--
Launch the install-script

 OR

Just untar oyster into a directory which is reachable to your
webserver. Now make sure that the webserver is able to read this
directory and its contents. Also it should be able to create new
files and directories here.

--Configuration--

Open the location http://servername/oyster in your browser. Here
you can edit your first configuration, test it and start oyster.

--Enjoy--
That's it. Start oyster (via the GUI, or by hand with ``python oyster.py'') and
it will search in $mediadir for ogg and mp3 files, build a playlist and start
playing.
